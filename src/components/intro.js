            Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I have three years of full-time experience working with Python and medical imaging algorithms development, data pipeline, and cloud deployment, at Veytel and Clario. 
            I thoroughly enjoy coding and learning state-of-the-art technologies. I am an enthusiast for developing data-driven solutions that optimize operational efficiency and elevate human well-being, particularly in healthcare and environmental sustainability.

            I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a master's degree in Electrical and
              Computer Engineering (AI/ML Systems concentration). 
                My research interests span across <Box component="span" fontWeight="bold">machine learning</Box>, <Box component="span" fontWeight="bold">3D vision</Box>, <Box component="span" fontWeight="bold">image segmentation</Box>, and <Box component="span" fontWeight="bold">model deployment</Box>.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and collaborating throughout my journey.
            Feel free to reach out at <Box component="span" sx={{ color: "#ff5722" }}>shaoyuli@alumni.cmu.edu</Box> or send me an invite on LinkedIn â€” Iâ€™m always open to new conversations!
